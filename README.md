Bundle and Coffee: Guiena pig cafe 

Bundle and Coffee is a cosy cafe which is the home to guiena pigs. This cafe is designed for those who love pets, especially guiena pigs, but might not have them at home. The Guiena pig cafe is located in Hackney which is a London bourogh full with families who might not have the space in their flats to have pets at home. This cafe makes it possible for families or indviduals to come and play with the guiena pigs without the responisbility or commitment!

The website will allow you to make enquiries, book a play session with the guiena pigs, meet the pets and browse the menu.

<li>Landing image of the Guiena pig. 
This photo is of one of my own guiena pigs emerging from a soft hidey house. Users will see this and will hopefully see how it captures the joyfulness and playfulness of not only the guiena pigs, but the cafe itself. It's border edges are smooth to create a soft, gentler feel to the website. </li>

<li>Background image:
I plan to use a faded image of coffee beans for the whole background on the website pages.</li>
