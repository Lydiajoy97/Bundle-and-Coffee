<h2>Project Brief</h2>

Bundle and Coffee is a cosy cafe which is the home to Guinea pigs. This cafe is designed for those who love pets, especially Guinea pigs. The Guinea pig cafe is located in Hackney which is a London borough full of families who might not have the space in their flats to have pets at home. <br>
This cafe makes it possible for families or individuals to come and play with the Guinea pigs without the responsibility or commitment!
The website will allow you to make enquiries, book a play session with the Guinea pigs, meet the pets and browse the menu.

<h2>Design and Color scheme</h2>
<p>For the color scheme I wanted some browns and oranges as because that would match the colors of the Guiena pigs themselves as one is ginger, and the browns would work alongside a coffee bean image.
<br> I then wanted to add some pink colors to add to the playfulness of the cafe, and to stand out and compliment the browns and oranges.<br>
For the logo I want to use some of these colors, so that the color scheme runs throughout.<br>
I picked a dark grey for the text so that I was a good contrast from the background.</p>
